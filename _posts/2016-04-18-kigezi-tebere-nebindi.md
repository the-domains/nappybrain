description: "I'm going to ask you to create a picture in your mind. Close your eyes. It might help. Rocky grey hills stretching up towards the sky with a singular thought - touch the sky. Grassy knolls clinging to craggy, sharp ledges where the top soil had long been eroded, having been brought here by heavy, torrential rainfall that is common to this place."
