            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Kigezi - Tebere N'ebindi</h1><p>I'm going to ask you to create a picture in your mind. Close your eyes. It might help. Rocky grey hills stretching up towards the sky with a singular thought - touch the sky. Grassy knolls clinging to craggy, sharp ledges where the top soil had long been eroded, having been brought here by heavy, torrential rainfall that is common to this place.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8f146e26cfccbdadf9fb52c255661ef0de8b9502.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>October Writing Prompt (Coffeelicious) - Tebere N'ebindi</h1><p>When I got home that night, I noticed the smiling jack-o-lantern in my front yard was crushed. Darn it. My effort, etched into every line my knife cut, parroted back at me from adoring neighbours, gone. Bugs had already begun their own carving of my masterpiece, dragging whatever chunks they could carry back their tunnels.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a35df723c7b273ae70b38649ea2fa657e48c5b42.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Fermi Paradox Solved! - Tebere N'ebindi</h1><p>Maybe they just don't want to talk to us... With the hullabaloo surrounding the maybe-dyson-sphere around KIC 8462852, I'm sure we've all become somewhat familiar with the Fermi Paradox. If not, lemme summarize it this way, If there are so many aliens out there, how come they no want to talk to us?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/57643014cf71d3f202ae8f7975cc183ac487f864.jpg"></article>]]></description>
